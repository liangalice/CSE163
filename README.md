Canada's Population on map is from 2016
  - Initial map is displaying Canada's 2016 density km^2
  - One of the places (the super dark green near left middle) is slightly off by population because when parsing json and csv, the json's duplicates match up with csv name, and thus it gets overriden by later rows. ( can be fixed if wanted )
  - Legend in green is aligned with population density km^2
#
Canada's Temperature on map is predicted temp for July 2020
  - When temperature button is clicked, the visualization turns from displaying population km^2 to predicted high and predicted   low temperature for July 2020
  - Color of map shows the average change in temperature (predicted high - predicted low) for July 2020
  - Legend in red is aligned with delta of temperature
